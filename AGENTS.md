# Agent Guidelines for NixOS Homeserver Configuration

**Read README.md first for project architecture, hosts setup, and commands.**

When adding guidelines here, avoid duplicating README.md.
Keep README.md as the primary source for project conventions and information.

## Code Style & Conventions

- **Imports**: Group common imports at module top, use relative paths
- **Structure**: Modular configuration - one service per file when possible
